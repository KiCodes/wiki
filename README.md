# CS50 Project 1 (2020 Wiki)

### It is a web application Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia. On the main page, users see a list of the names of all pages in the encyclopedia and after a click on any entry, the user is taken directly to that entry page. On the entry page, the user can edit that entry’s Markdown content. Markdown content is converted to HTML before being displayed on the page. The user can search encyclopedia entries by typing titles or substrings into the search box in the sidebar. Clicking “Create New Page” in the sidebar takes the user to a page where they can create a new encyclopedia entry. Clicking “Random Page” in the sidebar takes the user to a random encyclopedia entry.
